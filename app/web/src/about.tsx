      <p className="drop-shadow-2xl">Owned and operated locally in the front range, Wild West Dent Repair was started by two friends.
        Kris and Jesse spent years chasing hail all over the USA, but always longed for home. Hanging up their
        travelling hats for good, these two technicians and business owners are dedicated to building their
        local community, right here.

          <p className="drop-shadow-2xl">Jesse grew up in a big family in a small town outside Philidelphia. At 13 he joined his father's tree surgery business -- an industry he stayed in until beginning paintless dent repair five years later. In 2011, Jesse rode his bicycle from coast to coast, a formative experience in his life. Four years later, in 2015, he and his wife Amy moved to Colorado and started a family together. Now with two school-age daughters, skiing, camping, biking, hiking, and living in the foothills.</p>

          <p className="drop-shadow-2xl">Kris Becker is a Colorado native that started Paintless Dent Repair in 2011. He has worked in body shops all over the country, including Florida, Alabama, Missouri, Mississippi, Georgia, Texas, Tennessee, Arkansas, Wyoming, South Dakota, Minnesota, and, of course, Colorado. Before starting Paintless Dent repair and chasing hail storms for work, Kris was traveling playing guitar in bands, so he is used to a life on the road. Kris loves the mountains of Colorado, he grew up climbing 14ers, backpacking, snowboarding and loves anything that takes you into the wilderness. Kris wanted to open this shop at home in Colorado so he can be close to the mountains all year. The shop sits below Green Mountain so he can ride his bike to the top and look out at the front range before work. Kris takes pride in his work and always strives to be the best. He knows the most up to date techniques in the industry and uses the knowledge gained from working all over the country to create the perfect Auto Hail Repair facility. You will know that your car is safe with Kris and youâ€™ll be excited to know you have a local dent guy for life. </p>
